# Project Title: Developing a resopnsive website from the scrach.

## Motivation
Now a day a speed of communication is fastest than ever. If some thing happens it will reach to millions and bellions with in a second or less than. 
It is a great opportunity for online business. Particulary in the developed nations the use of online business is booming. Majority of the people have 
smart phones in thier hands. It is possible to order your stuffs online, you can read and do what you want simply by using your smart phone, even with a
very small size screen. There fore simply developing any kind of website with out recongnizing this exsiting situaion is not working. And that is why I 
have been motivated to develope a website that is responsive whether the user have a very small or very large size of mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop or 
others.
## Actions taken to address the problem
First and for most reaching materials (reading, wathing, listinging and even form toutors) to get a better understanding about resposive mean and its respective 
elements. sckeching on paper the skeleton of the website and figour out the major parts of it and type of documents that would be used to develope the website.
Following that I started to coding html by incorportating the major elements like html, head, and body. next to that I incorporated viewport meta added for proper 
responsive behavior prior to copying and adding the stylesheet link from bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) in to my head tag html. 
Navbar with their own classes links migrated from bootstrap for proper responsive styling as a header. 
The header have a navbar brand represented by my full name and navbar links called contact, portfolio and about. 
For smaller size screens the navbar links gets hide and looks like a humberger. If you click on it the desplied vertically. For this effect I used jQuery and bootstrap 
bundele links from bootstrap. By incorporating different classes I tried to add up some effects on color, font, display and other parts of the header. At this point I 
duplicate the html in to three files with different file name but inter linked. The website has a sticky footer. I cutomized it by getting an input from bootstrap doc.
I also grabed scrip links from bootstrap and drop it at the very bottom part of the html body tag.I customized the breakpoins to have a full width content for extra 
small screen. While for other breakpoints it will have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. 
After the header section the three files specified above have different setup based on thier characterstics. 
For contact section I follow bootstrap guidance and copied some elements like table, lable, input, text area and button with their respective class and id.
For index section I used a text wrap to wrapped my image and pragraphs that discribe a littl bit about my self.
For portfolio part grid systeme is used to stack the columns on extra small size by making one full-width while having marigin on the left and right side of it for other 
breakpoints. In addition I used row, column, card body and card classes to have a responsive lay out. 

## Leason Learned
Through the development of this resonsive website I got a lot of experiance on html, css and documents under bootstrap. As it is said mostly practice make perfect.
Now I am by far better that where I were two weeks before. Now I develope my coding and knowledge and skill of developing a web site. Now I do have my own personal website.
